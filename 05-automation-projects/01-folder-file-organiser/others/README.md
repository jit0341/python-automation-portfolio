# Folder File Organizer Automation

## Problem
Many users keep all files in a single folder (such as Downloads or Desktop),
which makes file management difficult, time-consuming, and unorganized.

## Solution
This Python automation script organizes files into separate folders
based on their file types (PDFs, Images, Documents, Videos, etc.).
It helps users keep their folders clean and structured automatically.
