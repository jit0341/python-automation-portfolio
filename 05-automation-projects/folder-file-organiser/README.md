# Folder File Organizer Automation

## Problem
Many users keep all files in a single folder (such as Downloads or Desktop),
which makes file management difficult, time-consuming, and unorganized.

## Solution
This Python automation script organizes files into separate folders
based on their file types (PDFs, Images, Documents, Videos, etc.).
It helps users keep their folders clean and structured automatically.

## Tools Used
- Python
- os / shutil

## How to Run
1. Place the script inside the target folder
2. Run the command: python organizer.py
3. Files will be automatically organized into folders

## Use Cases
- Office staff handling daily files
- Freelancers managing project files
- Students organizing study materials
- Small businesses managing documents

## Future Improvements
- Custom folder rules
- GUI-based version
